After configuring the software, you will need to compile it for your system. Simply issue the command `make` in the root of the source directory and the software will be compiled. If you have *any* problems at this stage, be certain to send a bug report See [Bug Reports](http://172.16.127.202/Bug-Reports.html#Bug-Reports).
