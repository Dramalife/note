[Ref -  ELF for the Arm Architecture ABI - Arm ](https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0044/g/aaelf32.pdf?_ga=2.188288424.1007038862.1568015789-2094371923.1568015789)   

**ABI** Application Binary Interface:   
1. The specifications to which an executable must conform in order to execute in a specific   
execution environment. For example, the Linux ABI for the Arm Architecture.   
2. A particular aspect of the specifications to which independently produced relocatable files   
must conform in order to be statically linkable and executable. For example, the C++ ABI for   
the Arm Architecture, the Run-time ABI for the Arm Architecture, the C Library ABI for the   
Arm Architecture.   
**AEABI** (Embedded) ABI for the Arm architecture (this ABI. . . )   
Arm-based . . . based on the Arm architecture . . .   
core registers The general purpose registers visible in the Arm architecture¡¯s programmer¡¯s model,   
typically r0-r12, SP, LR, PC, and CPSR.   
**EABI** An ABI suited to the needs of embedded, and deeply embedded (sometimes called free standing),   
applications.
