# CONSOLE PRINT
A start job is running for Raise network interfaces(ns/5min 3s)

# Setting timeout time
/etc/systemd/system/network-online.targets.wants/networking.service
# CHANGE : TimeoutStartSec=5min >> TimeoutStartSec=90sec

# 2020.01.12
# The reason is that /etc/network/interfaces only has config of interface eth0,
# my SBC(Bananapi R2) only link up eth1, so system init was blocked.
# On Ubuntu18, Bananapi R2`s interface eth1 as wan, and eth0 as lan(switch_bridge).
# So, just correct the network configuration!
