man(8)route
--------
gw GW  route packets via a gateway.
	NOTE: The specified gateway must be reachable first. This usually means that you have to set up a static route to the  gateway  beforehand.  If  you  specify  the
	address  of  one  of your local interfaces, it will be used to decide about the interface to which the packets should be routed to. This is a BSDism compatibility
	hack.

EXAMPLES
	route add -net 192.57.66.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw mango
		This command adds the net "192.57.66.x" to be gatewayed through the former route to the SLIP interface.

	route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
		This is an obscure one documented so people know how to do it. This sets all of the class D (multicast) IP routes to go via "eth0". This  is  the  correct
		normal configuration line with a multicasting kernel.
