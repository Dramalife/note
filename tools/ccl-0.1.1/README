README for ccl - customizable configuration library
===================================================

ccl is the customizable configuration library, a collection of
functions for application programmers wishing to interface with
user-editable configuration files containing key/value pairs.

ccl is customizable because it allows the comment, key/value, and
string literal delimiters to be programatically specified at runtime.

ccl is designed to be simple and portable; it has a small interface
consisting of five functions and is written in ANSI/ISO C. ccl uses
avl's implemenation of binary search trees for backend storage.
