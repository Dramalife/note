  What does "IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP: No such device" mean? 
  
  It means that the tool is trying to use multicast but the network interface doesn't support it There are two likely causes: 
  o 	your machine doesn't have multicast support enabled. 
  	For example, on Linux and FreeBSD it is possible to compile a kernel which doesn't support multicast.  
  o 	you don't have a route for multicast traffic. 
  	Some systems don't add this by default, and you need to run : 
  	route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 224.0.0.0 eth0)or similar). 
  	If you wish to use RAT in unicast mode only, 
  	it is possible to add the multicast route on the loopback interface.
